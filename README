Just some playing round with Python and Web Stuff, using "make a python version of the boardgame Acquire" as an excuse.

lobby - a REST interface for listing games and (eventually) asking to join them
acquire - the python code that encapsulates the boardgame itself
clientweb - a client that visits the lobby and can play/render the game
clientlocal - a client that runs on the native machine

NOTE: run these apps from the root folder via:
(virtual-env) $ python3 -m lobby.server
(virtual-env) $ python3 -m acquire.player
etc.
