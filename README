Just some playing round with Python and Web Stuff, using "make a python version of the boardgame Acquire" as an excuse.

### File organization
server.js - the flask web server, loading all the blueprints (sub-pages)
lobby/lobbyrest - a REST interface for listing games and (eventually) asking to join them
games - the python code that encapsulates the games themselves
games/acquire - what will hopefully, eventually, be the game acquire
clientweb - a client that visits the lobby and can play/render the game
clientlocal - a client that runs on the native machine

### Running / Testing the code
Create a virtual-env and install the dependencies
(virtual-env) $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
NOTE: run these apps from the root folder via:
(virtual-env) $ python3 -m server
 - then launch a browser and point to: localhost:5000/test/tile

# to test the acquire classes (unit tests)
(virtual-env) $ python3 -m games.acquire.player
(virtual-env) $ python3 -m game.tiles
(virtual-env) $ python3 -m games.acquire.board
(virtual-env) $ python3 -m games.acquire.game
